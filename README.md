# Rate My Online Class
Rate My Online Class is an educational site where students evaluate, rate, and review teachers and courses.

# Description
Rate My Online Class is an educational site where students evaluate, rate, and review teachers and courses. It allows professors to receive stream payments and donations to keep making educational material for their students.

It also allows students to review classes before committing to them or registering. This will help you save thousands of dollars and time. Students can add a new class that doesnâ€™t exist on the app or rate one that already exists for a chance of winning NFTs.

Users can search for teachers by name or choose a department and rate its teachers or read reviews left by other students. The rating system allows you to assign one to five stars to your teachers within the following categories:

Effective
Integrity
Empathy
Respect
Determination
Homework


If you have ever attended a class taught by a difficult teacher, you know that his personality and skills can impact your school performance.

There are plenty of great ways to catch up in school when falling behind. But, by doing some research, you can set yourself up for success and increase your odds of getting a good grade before you ever enter the classroom.

In the future, we would like to add functionality for these NFTs to be used as a credit to take a class for free and more ways for students to work together.
